There isn't a business in the world that doesn't have spreadsheets to manage important numbers and spreadsheets to manage lists of tasks and spreadsheets to summarise important business information.

So why to so many people in business complain about spreadsheets? drowning in them? overwhelmed by them? lied to by them?

What is it about spreadsheets that drives people to such heights of love and hate?

<div class='jumbotron'>
<h2>You have a love/hate relationship with spreadsheets <small class='hn_strap'>we can make it love/love</small></h2>
</div>

Its easy really, we take the bits you love and we keep them, and we take the bits you hate and we throw them away. So what do you love about spreadsheets?
* control - you do things your way, spreadsheets work for you
* ease of use - functions in cells, we all understand functions in cells
* the power of **now** - not when the techie gets round to it, not when the budget is raised

We keep that in Hypernumbers - spreadsheet interface, 150+ functions identical to Excel - you already know how to use it.

The all we have to do is take away **all** the things you hate about spreadsheets, easie-peasie...

<div class='jumbotron'>
<h2>Nothing like a stack of pancakes to scoff to cheer you up <small class='hn_strap'>nothing like a stack of spreadsheets to aggregate to get you down</small></h2>
</div>

You're on a deadline. There's a email you have to send, but you don't want to. You know the longer you put off sending it the worse it will be - because the later the responses will come in - the more pressuse you will be under.

But you still can't bring yourself to send it.

<pre>Dear Team

Please send me your monthly report spreadsheets as ASAP.

I need to prepare my report for the big cheese...
</pre>

You have written the draft, just press send already. But then the spreadsheets will roll in, aargh!

How cool would it be if you could write a spreadsheet that could roll-up spreadsheets, this month, next month and month after? With Hypernumbers you can. You can query the data in all your spreadsheets and add it up simply.

*"Aha"*, you say to yourself, *"I see what you did there. You took a thing I hate doing, aggregating spreadsheets by hand, and turned it into a think I can't do, writing some sort of VB-thingie or database-thingie, you can't fool me!"*

Well we're not trying to fool you, you aggregate Hypernumbers spreadsheets using spreadsheet functions. Really. No fancy tricks.

<h2>Few spreadsheets get evil-broken, some spreadsheets get careless-broken <small class='hn_strap'>but almost all spreadsheets get thoughtless-broken</small></h2>
</div>

There are three types of people that get to see my spreadsheets - me, the one that builds it, thinks about the spreadsheets, puts in the formulae. Then there's my readers - the ones I want to look at the graphs, study the figures, understand what's going on. Finally there's the folk whose data I need.

Its the lookers and the data-enterers who thoughtless and carelessly break my spreadsheet. So how does Hypernumbers make that hate go away?

One click makes the spreadsheet a webpage - so the readers can read it. They **don't** carelessly break it because they **can't** careless break it.

Select the cells you want and one-click turns the spreadsheet into a form - the data enterers enter the data you need - ditto on the breakage front.

<h2>Nobody's favourite party game is 'Who Changed That Number?' <small class='hn_strap'>ever</small></h2>
</div>

Don't like sprouts, don't eat them. Don't like 'Who Changed That Number?', you never have to play it again.

Why?

Because Hypernumbers logs for audit **all changes** to **all cells** by **all people all the time**. I mean, why wouldn't you love that?

*(Go-on admit it, say to your self "I love that", if you're at work or on a train or in a coffeebar you can just think it, no need to come the wierdo...)*

<h2>You'll know I'm lying if I say its FREE, well its not <small class='hn_strap'>yet, but it will be</small></h2>
</div>

Most so-called business saying are guff, but there are two that I really believe in:

<div class='well text-primary'>Go into business to make money, you will make money, go into business to help your customers make money, you'll make more...</div>

Customer satisfaction and delight is the best way to make money.

The other one is less familiar unless you are in the internet game:

<div class='well text-primary'>I will invest in any technology business that can turn a $10bn market into a $1bn one</div>

This is why we are going to release Hypernumbers as an open source product - like WordPress - so that you can download it and run it yourself for free. If we can help you make your business run better, we can make money. Its a great model.

Before we can release it we need to finalise some stuff, like intellectual property, and documentation to make it easy to install.
